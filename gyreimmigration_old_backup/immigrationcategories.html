        <div style="clear:both">
          <p id="v-menu" class="v-menu">
        A key objective of Canada’s immigration policy is to help families reunite in Canada. To be eligible for Family Class sponsorship, individuals must have a close relative willing to sponsor them. This relative must be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident. No two cases are the same and care needs to be taken to ensure each application is complete. Missing information will cause delays in processing and the arrival of your family member in Canada.
          <br />
          <br />
          To qualify for Family Class Sponsorship: <br />
            <br />
            1.	There must be one of the following relationships present: 
            <br />
            - Spouse, common-law partner, or conjugal partner; or 
            <br />
            - Parent or grandparent; or 
- Dependent child; or 
            <br />
            - Intended adopted child under 18 years of age; or 
            <br />
            - Brother, sister, nephew, niece, or grandchild who is orphaned, under 18 years of age and not married or in a common-law relationship; or  
            <br />
          - Other relative, if the Sponsor has no relative listed above and no relatives who are Canadian citizens or Canadian Permanent Residents <br />
          <br />
          2.	The Sponsor must: <br />
            - Be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident (residing in Canada) who meets the eligibility requirements to sponsor 
            <br />
          - Have the ability and intention to carry out their responsibilities as a sponsor according to the Sponsorship Agreement </p>
